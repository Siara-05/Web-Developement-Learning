# 🚀 React Learning Journey

Hey there! 👋  
This repository is where I'm starting my journey with **React.js**, one of the most powerful JavaScript libraries for building modern user interfaces.

## 📚 What This Repo is About

Right now, this is just the beginning.  
I’ll be learning and building small projects as I explore the basics of React.

I'll keep updating this repo as I go — for now, here's what I'm focusing on:

### ✅ My Current Goals

- Understand how JSX works
- Create functional components
- Learn how props and state behave
- Handle events in React
- Start using basic React Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- React.js (using Create React App)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- VS Code
- Node.js & npm

## 🛠️ Note

This is a **learning and practice** repo. As I progress, I’ll clean up, organize the files, and build better projects step by step.

Thanks for checking out my journey! More updates coming soon. 😊
